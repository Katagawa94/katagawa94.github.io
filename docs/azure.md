# Azure at a glance
Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform that provides computing, storage, networking, databases, and AI services for building and running applications at scale.[2]
It offers IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS options delivered through Microsoft’s global infrastructure as a comprehensive, trusted cloud platform.[1][7]

## Core services
Core categories include Compute (Virtual Machines, App Service, Kubernetes Service), Storage (Blob, Files), Networking (Virtual Network), Databases (Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB), and AI/ML (Azure AI Services and Machine Learning).[3][2]
These managed services integrate to support modern application development, operations, and data/AI workloads end to end.[11][1]

## Pricing model
Most Azure services follow a pay‑as‑you‑go consumption model, so costs align with actual usage rather than fixed capacity.[5]
This flexibility helps optimize spend as workloads scale up or down over time.[5]

## Security and regions
Azure operates across a global network of Microsoft-managed datacenters with built-in services for identity, governance, and security.[7][1]
This global footprint enables deploying resources close to end users while meeting compliance and resiliency needs.[1][7]

## Common use cases
Typical scenarios include hosting web and API apps, data and analytics platforms, AI-powered solutions, IoT, and hybrid cloud extensions of on‑premises environments.[11][1]
Organizations use these capabilities to modernize applications, accelerate delivery, and derive insights from data at scale.[1][11]

## Getting started
Access the Azure Portal to create and manage resources through a unified web experience or use the integrated Cloud Shell for command-line workflows.[4]
Developers can also adopt Azure SDKs, CLI, and templates to automate provisioning and streamline CI/CD for services like App Service.[13][11]
Start with a small workload, validate costs and performance, and expand using reference architectures and training paths from Microsoft Learn.[9][11]
