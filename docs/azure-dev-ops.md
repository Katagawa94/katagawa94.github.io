# Azure DevOps at a glance
Azure DevOps is a cloud platform offering integrated tools for planning, coding, building, testing, and deploying software across the full development lifecycle.  
It brings together work tracking, source control, CI/CD, testing, and package management to support modern DevOps practices.

## Core services
- Azure Boards: Agile planning with backlogs, Kanban/Scrum boards, sprints, and dashboards.  
- Azure Repos: Git or TFVC repositories with pull requests, code reviews, and branch policies.  
- Azure Pipelines: Language-agnostic CI/CD for containers, VMs, and multiple clouds and platforms.  
- Azure Test Plans: Manual and exploratory testing with traceability to work items and builds.  
- Azure Artifacts: Private package feeds for NuGet, npm, Maven, Python, and universal packages.

## Typical workflow
- Plan in Boards, track user stories, bugs, tasks, and features.  
- Code in Repos with branches, pull requests, and policies for quality gates.  
- Build and test in Pipelines with automated triggers and multi-stage releases.  
- Validate in Test Plans, link results to requirements, and improve traceability.  
- Deploy via Pipelines to environments (dev, staging, production) with approvals and gates.

## Key benefits
- End-to-end visibility from requirements to deployments with dashboards and analytics.  
- Flexibility for any language, framework, platform, and target environment.  
- Enterprise security with identity integration, permissions, and compliance features.

## Pricing and access
- Free tier suitable for small teams with basic features to start quickly.  
- Paid options add users, parallel jobs, and advanced testing capabilities as needs grow.

## Getting started
- Create a project, define teams/areas/iterations, and set up Boards to model the process.  
- Import or create a repo, define branch policies, and enable pull request checks.  
- Author a Pipeline (YAML), add build/test steps, and configure environments and approvals.  
- Publish shared libraries to Artifacts and reference them across services and applications.
