# Hello World!

Welcome to our engineering handbook. This space explains how we work, how we ship software, and the core tools that support our day-to-day: GitHub, Bitbucket, Azure, and Datadog.

## Our core tools

**GitHub:** 
- Primary home for source code, issues, pull requests, and code review.

**Bitbucket:**
- Used for teams and repositories that still live in our Bitbucket workspace.
- Migration or mirroring paths are documented for repos moving to GitHub.

**Azure:**
- Our cloud platform for running apps and services, storage, networking, and secrets.
- Identity and access via Microsoft Entra ID; least-privilege roles apply to users, service principals, and pipelines.
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform/CDK for Terraform (CDKTF) defines environments and promotes changes through dev → stage → prod.

**Datadog:**
- Unified observability for logs, metrics, traces, and dashboards.
- Dashboards are the system of record for service health during deploys and incidents.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up for using the tools make sure to meet the most common requirements for them:
